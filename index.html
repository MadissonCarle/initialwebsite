				<h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently in 3rd year Software Engineering at the University of Calgary. Since starting postsecondary I have learned a lot about myself and about how I think. I have always been a very logical thinker, finding the most interest in math and physics, but I also have always loved to apply logical thoughts and knowledge in a creative way. I enjoy the process of building things from scratch and turning an idea into something tangible. After finishing first year I found interest in using programming as a medium for me to create new things and implement my ideas in a different way. Programming has allowed for me to express myself and learn new things not only at school but also in life. <p>
Throughout the past year my programming abilities have been drastically strengthened and I have used my new kindled interest in the programming industry to learn about the field not only in school but also leisurely by trying new things such as this website. 
Most of my knowledge is in C/C++, Java and SQL. However, knowing these languages has allowed me to quickly pickup other similar languages making me adaptable and always up for a challenge. 
</p>
                <p></p>
                <h2>My Interests Outside of School</h2>
                <p>Growing up I have always been a team player and enjoy working in group environments. During previous summers I have worked at a non-profit summer camp for the community which I found to be a great opportunity to teach kids about leadership and teamwork. Being an ambassador of these skills has allowed me to strengthen my own and learn to cooperate well with teams. I also was a leader of the science camp at this summer camp so I could introduce young children to the vast applications of science all around us. Through my experiences with children and a team network, I have learned a lot about myself and have been able to use the imagination of children to see things in a new perspective. 
                    </p>
                <p>
Outside of school I enjoy music and learning new instruments. Currently I can play the flute, the Alto and Tenor Saxophone, the Piano, and am teaching myself the guitar and ukulele. I also enjoy building things with my hands such as sewing and the occasional woodwork project with my parents. 
Overall, I think my ability to combine the logical with the creative makes me a well rounded individual able to take on any challenge.
